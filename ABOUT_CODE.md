# About This Code

Since this project doesn't use a popular framework with well-established code-org conventions, this file will attempt to explain, so whether you want to contribute or just have a good look at the code, you won't be utterly lost.

## Overall organization
- Static files in `public/`
- Rust files in `src/`
- Javascript in `web-src/`
- wasm-bindgen autogenerated files in `web-src/wasm/`
- Images in `web-src/images/`
- Scripts in `scripts/`

## JS Organization
- `index.js` creates a `Game`
- `Game`s create a `Store` and pass it to `Transition`s
- `Transition`s start and stop `Animation`s
- `Animation`s call `FrameRenderer`s every 60 milliseconds or so
- A `FrameRenderer` draws a still frame.
